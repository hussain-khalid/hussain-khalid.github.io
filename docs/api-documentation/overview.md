This section provides sample documentation using the Agora Video SDK and REST APIs.  

- The **SDK quickstart guide** shows how to implement video calling in an Android project.  
- The **REST API guide** shows how to implement video calling using REST APIs.  

For more details, see the [Agora Developer Documentation](https://docs.agora.io/).  

> **Note:** These guides are for demonstration purposes only. They highlight my technical writing skills and are not official Agora documentation.
