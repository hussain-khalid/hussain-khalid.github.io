# Writing samples overview

This section contains examples of my technical writing work across various documentation types and formats.

The samples demonstrate my experience creating clear, practical documentation for software products, with a focus on developer guides, API references, SDK documentation, and user training materials that improve onboarding and customer satisfaction.

## Documentation types

This portfolio includes the following types of technical documentation:

### API documentation
- **REST API guides**: Interactive documentation with testing interface, similar to ChatGPT's API playground
- **SDK integration guides**: Multi-language implementation guides for JavaScript, C++, Java, C#, and React Native
- **Reference documentation**: Comprehensive API references with live code examples and response formats

### User guides and onboarding
- **Step-by-step tutorials**: User onboarding flows and feature walkthroughs
- **Getting started guides**: Quick-start documentation for new users
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Common issues and solutions

### Developer tools and processes
- **Documentation workflows**: Docs-as-code implementations using modern tools
- **Content strategy**: Modular content systems and reusable components
